# Dlink-Mgmt

A Perl module for D-Link L2 network switches management. At current time only russian documentation is present, but the code is trivial, so it doesn't require much explaination. Anyway, feel free to write documentation in English, German or any other language. My contacts are - tomcat-dst (Skype) and vlad.syan@gmail.com.
